# GVM

A simple Java interpreter written wit Go language. This project is to learn JVM specification in depth and try to understand the
under-the-water mechanism when a Java program runs.

Basically, I just refer to "Java Virtual Machine Specification" and many implementations are naive and simplified so as to
validate the idea.

# Roadmap

- Java class parser
- Interpreter
- Bridge JNI native method
- NO GC
