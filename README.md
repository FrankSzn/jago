# gvm

A simple Java interpreter written wit Go language. This project is to learn JVM specification in depth and try to understand the
under-the-water mechanism when a Java program runs.

Basically, I just reference "Java Virtual Machine Specification" and many implementations are so naive and simplified to
validate the idea.
